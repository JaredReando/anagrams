# Anagram Checker

#### _Ruby anagram checking application._

#### By _**Jared Reando**_

## Description

_A Ruby terminal application that compares two strings and evaluates whether or not they are anagrams of each other. To do this, the program checks for the following:_
  * Does either strings contain only letters?
  * Disregarding case, do both strings contain exactly the same letters as each other?
  * Do the inputted strings contain NONE of the same letters? If none match, program identifies inputs as antigrams of each other
